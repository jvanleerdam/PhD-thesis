%error correction for background,
%simultaneous in KK-mass bins and tagging categories

To extract the theoretical parameters that describe the \BstoJpsiKK{} decay from the experimental data, the model of decay time and decay
angles, as discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:pheno}, is fitted to the distribution of events in the data. Several experimental effects have to
be taken into account in this fit. Some of these effects, for instance the uncertainty in the measurement of the decay time, are included
by modifying the theoretical model. Backgrounds, on the other hand, are dealt with by selecting signal-like decay candidates in the data
and by subtracting remaining background from the data after selection.

This chapter deals with the preparation of experimental data (Section~\ref{sec:ana_bkgSub}) and the model that can be used to fit these
data (Sections~\ref{sec:ana_time}--\ref{sec:ana_tagging}). Also the use of the decay model in the fit (Section~\ref{sec:ana_fit}) and in
simulation (Section~\ref{sec:ana_sim}) are discussed.
