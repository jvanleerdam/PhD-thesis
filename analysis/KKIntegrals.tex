\section{\texorpdfstring{$\KK$}{KK}-Mass Integrals}
\label{sec:ana_KKIntegrals}

As discussed in Sections~\ref{sec:pheno_KKMass} and \ref{subsec:pheno_equations_symmetry}, the dependence of the differential decay rate on
$\KK$ mass is summarized in the PDF by the quantities $\CSP$ and $\thetaSP$, which represent the $\KK$-mass integral of the rate. A
separate PDF is constructed for each bin in $\KK$ mass, with values of $\CSP$ and $\thetaSP$ that correspond to the $\KK$-mass shapes in
the bin.

The phase $\thetaSP$ is absorbed in the phase difference between the $\Jpsiphi$ and the S-wave amplitudes (see
Equations~\ref{eq:couplingFacAmps} and \ref{eq:phaseDiffDef}), which is measured for each bin. In principle, the $\CSP$ values could also
be measured, but because these factors only modify the magnitudes of the small S-wave interference terms more data would be needed for a
sensible measurement. For this measurement the $\CSP$ factors are computed and fixed in the fit of time and angles.

The decay model of Chapter~\ref{chap:pheno} is integrated over $\KK$ mass, where it is assumed the mass shape of the \BstoJpsiphi{} decay
is described by a relativistic Breit-Wigner function (see e.g.\ reference \cite{PDG}) and the $\KK$ S-wave contribution to the
\BstoJpsiKK{} decay by a Flatt\'e function~\cite{Flatte:1976xu}. Because the $\KK$-mass measurement has a finite resolution of
approximately 1\unitsp{}\MeV, these functions are convoluted with a resolution function, which is determined from the resolution in
simulated decays (see Reference~\cite{LHCb-ANA-2014-039}). The resulting $\CSP$ factors are listed in the third column of
Table~\ref{tab:CSPFactors}.

           The $\CSP$ factors are computed for three different scenarios~\cite{LHCb-ANA-2014-039}:
           the nominal $\KK$-mass model with a Flatt\'e mass shape for the S-wave and the mass resolution estimated with simulated decays,
           a scenario with a 20\% worse $\KK$-mass resolution, and a scenario with a uniform $\KK$-mass shape for the S-wave.}

\end{table}

Systematic uncertainties related to the assumed mass shapes and resolution are evaluated by varying these inputs (see
Section~\ref{sec:result_syst}). To this end the $\CSP$ factors are recalculated with a 20\% worse $\KK$-mass resolution (fourth column in
Table~\ref{tab:CSPFactors}) and with a uniform $\KK$-mass shape for the S-wave (fifth column in Table~\ref{tab:CSPFactors}).
