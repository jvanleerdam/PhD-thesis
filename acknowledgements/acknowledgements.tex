Many people have, directly or indirectly, contributed to my PhD thesis, for which I am grateful. I was given the opportunity to do both my
master's and doctoral research at Nikhef, where I always received all the support I needed. My thesis could not have been written without
the help from my advisors, collaboration with people in our group at Nikhef and the LHCb experiment, all the people that made it possible
to study particles from LHC collisions with data from the LHCb detector, many discussions about physics and various other topics at Nikhef
and \cern, people proofreading the thesis draft, and everyone who provided the necessary moral support. Thank you all.
