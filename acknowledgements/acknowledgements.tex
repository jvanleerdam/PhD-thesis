Many people have, directly or indirectly, contributed to my PhD thesis, for which I am grateful. I was given the opportunity to do both my
master's and doctoral research at Nikhef, where I always received all the support I needed. My thesis could not have been written without
the help from my advisors, collaboration with people in our group at Nikhef and the LHCb experiment, people preparing and understanding the
experimental and simulated data I used, all the discussions about physics and various other topics at Nikhef and \cern, people
proofreading the thesis draft, and everyone who provided the necessary moral support. Thank you all.
