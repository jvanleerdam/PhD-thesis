{\Large\bf
  Measurement of CP Violation in Mixing and Decay of Strange Beauty Mesons
}
\vspace*{0.05\textwidth}

\noindent
Combining beauty and strange quarks yields ``strange beauty mesons''. The bound state of antibeauty and strange is a $\Bs$ meson, beauty
and antistrange form the corresponding antiparticle, denoted by $\Bsbar$.

An important feature of these particles is that they can turn into each other, which creates a mixed system of a particle and its
antiparticle. Starting with a $\Bs$ meson, the particle evolves and can be either a $\Bs$ or a $\Bsbar$ meson at the time it decays into
other particles. The other way around, a particle created as a $\Bsbar$ meson also has a probability to decay as a $\Bs$ meson.

A particularly interesting mode of decay is that into a $\Jpsi$ meson and a $\phimes$ meson, which is possible for both $\Bs$ and $\Bsbar$.
This mode creates two possible decay paths for a given initial particle, either $\Bs$ or $\Bsbar$. One path where the initial particle
first turns into its antiparticle an then decays into the $\Jpsiphi$ final state and one path where the initial particle decays directly
into this state.
