{\Large\bf
  Measurement of CP Violation in Mixing and Decay of Strange Beauty Mesons
}
\vspace*{0.05\textwidth}

\noindent
Despite its precise and accurate description of elementary-particle interactions, the Standard Model of Particle Physics has several
shortcomings. To find a more complete description of nature, particle interactions are tested for deviations from Standard Model
predictions, which would indicate how to extend the model. The LHCb experiment at \cern's Large Hadron Collider searches for such
deviations in the description of particle decays.

In particular, the LHCb experiment studies decays of the bound states formed by beauty and strange quarks, or ``strange beauty mesons''.
The combination of antibeauty and strange is a $\Bs$ meson, beauty and antistrange form the corresponding antiparticle, denoted by
$\Bsbar$.

An important feature of these particles is that they can turn into each other, which creates a mixed system of a particle and its
antiparticle. Starting with a $\Bs$ meson, the particle evolves and can be either a $\Bs$ or a $\Bsbar$ meson at the time it decays into
other particles. The other way around, a particle created as a $\Bsbar$ meson also has a probability to decay as a $\Bs$ meson.

A particularly interesting mode of decay is that into a $\Jpsi$ meson and a $\phimes$ meson, which occurs for both $\Bs$ and $\Bsbar$. For
this mode there are two possible decay paths for each of the two initial particles. In one path the initial particle first turns into its
antiparticle an then decays into the $\Jpsiphi$ final state and in the other path the initial particle decays directly into this state.

This mixing and decay process is predicted to be almost identical for $\Bs$ and $\Bsbar$ by the Standard Model. Measurements indicate that
the difference in the rates for the transitions from $\Bs$ to $\Bsbar$ and vice versa are very small. Also the rates of the decays into the
$\Jpsiphi$ state are expected to be nearly equal. This equivalence between matter and antimatter is known as \emph{CP symmetry}.

Although it is small in the Standard Model, there is some violation of CP symmetry expected for the \BstoJpsiphi{} process.
