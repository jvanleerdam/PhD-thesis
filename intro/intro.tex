\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}

The main objective of the work presented in this thesis is the measurement of CP violation in the decay \BstoJpsiphi. This measurement is a
test of the current model of elementary-particle interactions. It is performed within the LHCb experiment, which studies particles produced
in the proton--proton collisions of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at \cern{} in Geneva, Switzerland. The results presented here (see also
reference~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2014,*LHCb-ANA-2014-039}) are an update of previous LHCb results \cite{LHCb-PAPER-2013-002,*LHCb-ANA-2012-067}
with a dataset that is more than three times larger.

Motivations for such a test of particle-physics models are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:intro_SM}. The measurement is introduced in
Sections~\ref{sec:intro_Jpsiphi} and \ref{sec:intro_LHCb}, after an introduction to CP violation in this context in
Section~\ref{sec:intro_CPV}.

Details of the phenomenology of the \BstoJpsiphi{} decay are discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:pheno}. A discussion of the  measurement and
the applied data-analysis techniques can be found in Chapters~\ref{chap:exp} and \ref{chap:ana}, respectively. Finally, results of the
measurement are presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:result}.
