\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}

The main objective of the work presented here is the measurement of CP violation in the decay \BstoJpsiphi. This measurement is a test of
the current model of elementary-particle interactions, which is known to be incomplete. The measurement is done within the LHCb experiment,
which studies particles produced in the proton--proton collisions of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at \textsc{Cern} in Geneva,
Switzerland.

Motivations for such a test of particle-physics models are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:intro_SM}. The measurement is introduced in
Sections~\ref{sec:intro_Jpsiphi} and \ref{sec:intro_LHCb}, after an introduction of CP violation in this context in
Section~\ref{sec:intro_CPV}.

Details of the phenomenology of the \BstoJpsiphi{} decay are discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:pheno}. A discussion of the  measurement and
the applied data-analysis techniques can be found in Chapters~\ref{chap:exp} and \ref{chap:ana}, respectively. Finally, the results of
the measurement are presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:result}.
