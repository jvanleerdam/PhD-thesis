defense:
* what are the motivations for BSM searches (new physics in introduction)
* BSM models that affect phi_s
* why is CPV time dependent? weak phase -2beta_s always seems to be there... (this is only weak phase)
* understand resolution plots in intro
* Why is the error on phi_s slightly smaller in |lambda|=1 model? Only a 2% correlation between phi_s and |lambda|.
  Shift in parameter values (Deltam->resolution?, delta_perp?), makes error on Deltam larger instead of smaller.
* Differences of parameter values in Deltam-constraint fit with respect to nominal values corresponds with correlations.
  What about uncertainties?
* Hard to say what to expect from fits in narrow KK-mass window. Errors go up with respect to wide window,
  but what about the differences between one bin and four bins?
* Jarlskog maximum 1/6/sqrt(3): why?
* colour drag: difference in B/Bbar phase space? --> production asymmetry
* why do we expect a different acceptance for 2011 and 2012?
* what is causing the reconstruction-acceptance (VELO, algorithms?)
* how is reconstruction-acceptance beta determined (real data + MC?)
* How do we (Diego) generate background for toys again?!
* Which bins in conditional observables were used in the toys?
* What should I have done with contrained parameters in toys (fixed them now)?
* interference terms in KK-mass plot?! (why would you see interference if you integrate over angles?)
* why does the even states to the light state and the odd states to the heavy state?
* dilution weights in oscillation plot: optimal?
* resultaten voor de drie verschillende modellen: verklaar verschillen/overeenkomsten.
* do you really expect phi_s^av ~ phi_s, or is this because Deltaphi_s^i ~ 0?
* numbers of tagged and untagged events?

thesis:
* reference for Yukawa interaction (Section 1.1.1)
* reference for Lorentz invariance -> CPT invariance in QFT (Section 1.1.1)
* b production mechanism
  - how much bb and single b
  - contributions from which bb diagrams?
* mass figures with residuals Section 3.2: at the right pages to compare?
* x-axis labels of pull distributions in results chapter should read "pull"
