defense:
* BSM models that affect phi_s
* why is CPV time dependent? weak phase -2beta_s always seems to be there... (this is only weak phase)
* understand resolution plots in intro

thesis:
* interference terms in KK-mass plot?!
* b production mechanism
  - how much bb and single b
  - contributions from which bb diagrams?
