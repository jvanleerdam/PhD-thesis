defense:
* BSM models that affect phi_s
* why is CPV time dependent? weak phase -2beta_s always seems to be there... (this is only weak phase)
* understand resolution plots in intro
* Why is the error on phi_s slightly smaller in |lambda|=1 model? Only a 2% correlation between phi_s and |lambda|.
  Shift in parameter values (Deltam->resolution?, delta_perp?), makes error on Deltam larger instead of smaller.

thesis:
* interference terms in KK-mass plot?!
* b production mechanism
  - how much bb and single b
  - contributions from which bb diagrams?
