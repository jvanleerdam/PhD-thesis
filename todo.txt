defense:
* what are the motivations for BSM searches
* BSM models that affect phi_s
* why is CPV time dependent? weak phase -2beta_s always seems to be there... (this is only weak phase)
* understand resolution plots in intro
* Why is the error on phi_s slightly smaller in |lambda|=1 model? Only a 2% correlation between phi_s and |lambda|.
  Shift in parameter values (Deltam->resolution?, delta_perp?), makes error on Deltam larger instead of smaller.
* Differences of parameter values in Deltam-constraint fit with respect to nominal values corresponds with correlations.
  What about uncertainties?
* Hard to say what to expect from fits in narrow KK-mass window. Errors go up with respect to wide window,
  but what about the differences between one bin and four bins?
* Jarlskog maximum 1/6/sqrt(3): why?

thesis:
* reference for Yukawa interaction (Section 1.1.1)
* reference for Lorentz invariance -> CPT invariance in QFT (Section 1.1.1)
* update resolution plots in intro: LHCB-CERN-LHCB-DP-2014-002-001
* interference terms in KK-mass plot?!
* b production mechanism
  - how much bb and single b
  - contributions from which bb diagrams?
